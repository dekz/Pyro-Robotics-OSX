                         -------------------------------

DESCRIPTION

  Khepera Simulator is a simulation tool as well as a Khepera robot driver.
  It is presented as a package including C sources to be compiled and linked
  with your own C or C++ programs. To drive the simulator, you just need to
  fill in the C functions given in the file user.c and to compile it using the
  makefile also provided. Please see the examples in the directory EXAMPLES.

  Khepera Simulator uses a X11 color graphical interface with buttons.

  Khepera Simulator includes a world editor, a robot sensors viewer, and user
  area where you can write and draw anything.

  The simulator makes use of the 8 infrared sensors of the robots for distance
  measurements as well as light measurements. It drives the two motors of the
  robot and detects collisions with obstacles.

  To code your own algorithm to drive the simulated / real robot, you should
  read the tutorial given in the DOCS directory. A user manual is also
  available in this directory (postcript versions as well as a text version
  are available).


NAME

  sim - Khepera Simulator binary executable


SYNTAX

  sim [options]


FLAGS

  -s  simulation only (do not make use of the serial link for the real Khepera)
  -p  simulated serial mode (see example 4 for using this option)


INITIALIZATION FILES

  .simrc contains 3 important paramters:
  KHEPERA_AVAILABLE: may be TRUE or FALSE, depending if a real Khepera robot is
                     connected or not.
  SERIAL_PORT:       is serial port device to which the robot is connected
                     (if available). It could be /dev/ttya, /dev/ttyb or
                     /dev/tty00 depending on the workstation and the ports you
                     use.
                     This value is used only when KHEPERA_AVAILABLE is TRUE.
  MONODISPLAY:       may be TRUE or FALSE according to the type of screen used.


HISTORY

  November 15, 1995: Khepera Simulator version 1.0 (first freeware release)

  March     1, 1996: Khepera simulator version 2.0 (second freeware release)

    o The IR distance sensor model was improved and is now more relevant
      comparing to the real sensor and more efficent in computational power.
    o The random generator was made more standard to work on LINUX and some
      other systems (thanks to Nils Hulth).
    o The grey colors were a bit changed to fit with some HP workstations
      (idea: Edmund Ronald)
    o The serial communication module was modified to run on the same HP
      workstations (thanks to Marc Schoenauer).
    o New examples of efficient robots were added in example 2: big.robot and
      leaning.robot (idea: Edmund Ronald, Jari Vaario).
    o The manual was updated.
    o This readme file was modified (idea: Jari Vaario).
    o The makefile was modified for an easy modification of the lib and
      include directories (idea: Jari Vaario). A make clean capability was
      added.
    o The set angle command is now a standard command (idea: Jari Vaario).
    o The examples installation files were modified.
    o A multi-agent module was included (example 3, designed by Manuel
      Clergue <clerguem@alto.unice.fr>).
    o A simulated serial device module was added (example 4). This module is
      especially useful if you already developped a program sending serial
      commands to a real Khepera through the serial link of your computer. It
      allows to redirect these commands to Khepera Simulator (idea: Jean-Yves
      Tigli).
