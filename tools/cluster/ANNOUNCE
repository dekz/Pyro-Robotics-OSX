Dear Connectionists:

After several months of testing I'm releasing a slightly revised version
my enhanced cluster utility.  A major memory allocation glitch was fixed
and support for System 5 curses pads was added.

I should note that for viewing the graph output of cluster the original
version of the xgraph program is not enough because it cannot handle
labeled datapoints. An enhanced version that works well with cluster can
be ftped at the same location as cluster (see below).
