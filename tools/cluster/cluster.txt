       CClluusstteerr performs Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) on  a
       set of vectors and outputs the result in a variety of for­
       mats on standard output.

       PPccaa performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on  a  set
       of  vectors  and  prints the transformed set of vectors on
       standard output.

       If _v_e_c_t_o_r_f_i_l_e is given it is read as the  file  containing
       the vector data, one vector per line, components separated
       by whitespace.  An optional  _n_a_m_e_s_f_i_l_e  can  be  given  to
       assign  names (arbitrary strings) to these vectors.  Names
       must be specified one per line,  matching  the  number  of
       vectors  in  _v_e_c_t_o_r_f_i_l_e.  Names are either contiguous non-
       whitespace characters or arbitrary strings delimited by an
       initial double quote `"' and the end of line.

       Vector  names may also be given in _v_e_c_t_o_r_f_i_l_e itself, fol­
       lowing the vector components on each line.   If  no  names
       are  provided,  vectors  in  the  output are identified by
       their input sequence number instead.

       Either of these files may be given as `--', indicating that
       the corresponding information should be read from standard
       input.  If no arguments are given standard input is  read,
       allowing cclluusstteerr to be used as a filter.

       CClluusstteerr  and  ppccaa  also provide a simple scaling facility.
       If the first line of the input is terminated by  the  key­
       word  `__SSCCAALLEE__'  it  is interpreted as a vector of scaling
       factors.  The following lines are then  read  as  data  as
       usual,  except  that  vector  components are multiplied by
       their corresponding scaling factors.  To  specify  scaling
       factors on the command line use
            (echo _f_a_c_t_o_r_1 _f_a_c_t_o_r_2 ... _SCALE_ ; \
            cat _v_e_c_t_o_r_f_i_l_e ) | cluster - [ _n_a_m_e_s_f_i_l_e ]

       Yet another potentially useful feature is that vector com­
       ponents may be specified as `DD//CC'  (don't  care),  meaning
       that that component will always contribute zero in comput­
       ing distances to other vectors.  In  PCA  mode,  each  D/C
       value  is replaced by the mean of all non-D/C values along
       its dimension.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --pp     Force PCA mode, even when the program is called  as
              cclluusstteerr.   (cclluusstteerr  and ppccaa are different incarna­
              tions of the same program, depending on the  zeroth
              argument.)

       --ss     Suppress   scaling.    Vector  components  are  not
              scaled, even if a __SSCCAALLEE__ line was found.  This  is
              useful to produce both scaled and unscaled analyses
              from the same input file.

       --vv     Verbose output. Reports the number and dimension of
              vectors  read and precedes each output section with
              an explanatory message.  For ppccaa ,, execution of the
              computational steps involved is reported.

   CClluusstteerr oonnllyy
       --dd     Output  all  pairs  of  clusters formed, along with
              their respective inter-cluster distances.  Clusters
              are given as lists of vectors.

       --tt     Represent the hierarchical clusters as a tree lying
              on its side.  The leaves of the tree are formed  by
              vector  names,  and  the horizontal spacing between
              nodes is  proportional  to  the  distances  between
              clusters.   The  output uses only ASCII characters,
              resulting in a rough approximation of the true pro­
              portions.

       --TT     Same  as  --tt but the cluster tree is displayed in a
              ccuurrsseess(3) pad.  The terminal screen can be scrolled
              around the tree representation.  Also, VT100 graph­
              ics characters are used for line drawing if  avail­
              able.   While  displaying  the  tree, the following
              one-key commands can be used:
              Home, H   Scroll to upper-left corner of window.
              h, j, k, l, arrow keys
                        Scroll left, down, up, right by one posi­
                        tion.
              Tab, BackTab
                        Scroll right, left by 8 positions.
              n, p      Sroll down, up by one page.
              R         Redraw screen.
              q         Quit the display.

       --ww_w_i_d_t_h
              Set the width of the tree representation used by --tt
              and --TT to _w_i_d_t_h characters.  The default  width  is
              80   or   the   terminal  width  as  determined  by
              ccuurrsseess(3).  Wider trees are more difficult to  view
              but  give  a more accurate picture of relative dis­
              tances.

       --gg     Same as --tt, but the graphical output  is  specified
              in  a  format suitable for the UNIX ggrraapphh(1G) util­
              ity, which allows further formatting such as bound­
              ing   box,  axes  labels,  rotation,  and  scaling.
              GGrraapphh(1G) in turn  produces  plotting  instructions
              according  to the pplloott(5) format, for which a vari­
              ety of output filters  exist.   The  following  are
              typical command lines.

              Previewing on a standard terminal:
                   cluster -g | graph -g1 | plot -Tcrt
              Previewing under X windows:
                   cluster -g  | graph -g1 | xplot
              or
                   cluster -g  | xgraph
              If  neither  xplot nor xgraph are available, run an
              xxtteerrmm(1) switched to Tektronics mode and use
                   cluster -g | graph -g1 | plot -Ttek
              Converting to postscript:
                   cluster -g | graph -g1 | psplot
              Printing on a printer supporting pplloott ((55)) format:
                   cluster -g | graph -g1 | lpr -g

       --bb     Same as --gg, except that double drawing of lines  is
              avoided, thus saving space and time.  This requires
              however that ggrraapphh be called with the --bb option  to
              correctly assemble the tree from pieces:
                   cluster -b | graph -b

       --BB     The input vectors are output as bit vectors induced
              by the cluster tree.  The cluster  tree  is  inter­
              preted as a code tree, i.e., for each left or right
              branch  are  `0'  or  `1'  bit,  respectively,   is
              printed.   An  `x'  is  used  to pad vectors to the
              depth of the tree.

       --nn_p    Norm to be used as distance metric between vectors.
              A  positive  integer  _p specifies a metric based on
              the L_p-norm.  The value 00 selects the maximum norm.
              The default is 22 (Euclidean distance).

       For  compatibility with an earlier version of the program,
       the default behavior of cclluusstteerr corresponds to the  combi­
       nation of options --ddttvv.

   PPccaa oonnllyy
       --ee_e_i_g_e_n_b_a_s_e
              Use  _e_i_g_e_n_b_a_s_e as a file with precomputed eigenvec­
              tors.  If the file exists, it is read and the rela­
              tively  costly  eigenvalue  computation is avoided.
              This also allows transforming a data set  according
              to principle components determined from a different
              data set.  If the file does not exist, an eigenbase
              is computed from the current input and saved in the
              file.

       --cc_p_c_1_,_p_c_2_,_._._.
              Select a subset of  the  principal  components  for
              output, as typically used for dimensionality reduc­
              tion of vector sets.  Components of the transformed
              vectors  are  listed  in the order specified by the
              comma-separated list of  numbers  _p_c_1,_p_c_2,...   For
              example, --cc44,,22 prints the fourth and second princi­
              pal components (in that order).

       --EE     Output the eigenvalues instead of  the  transformed
              input vectors.  Eigenvalues are printed in descend­
              ing order or as specified by the --cc  option.   This
              option  forces  recomputation of the eigenbase even
              if an  existing  file  is  specified  with  the  --ee
              option.

BBUUGGSS
       Halfhearted  error  handling.   If  vectors  and names are
       given in the same file, the name at the end of  the  first
       line  must  be  a non-numerical string, or it will be mis­
       taken as a vector component.

       The vector names at the leaves of the cluster tree tend to
       stretch  beyond  the  bounding box of the plot.  This is a
       feature since cclluusstteerr leaves the graphing process entirely
       to  ggrraapphh(1G),  which  doesn't  care  about  the length of
       strings.  This can be corrected by  explicitly  specifying
       an upper limit for the x coordinate.

       The clustering algorithm could be optimized further.

       Finally, this program is freely distributable, but  nobody
       should  try  to make money off of it, and it would be nice
       if researchers using it acknowledged the people  mentioned
       above.
