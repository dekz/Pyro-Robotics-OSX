Just a quick comment on your code, which I pulled over today (- I had it 
before at some stage), if I may.

Your algorithm has nothing to do with the single link method (of course both
are hierarchical clustering methods).  Given that your dissimilarity between
cluster centers is a straight Euclidean (or other metric) distance, and given
that your definition of cluster centers is a weighted average of the subcluster
centers, your algorithm is an implementation of the Centroid or UPGMC method.
The latter stands for something like 'Unweighted pair group method - 
centroids' - see PHA Sneath and RR Sokal, Numerical Taxonomy, Freeman, 1973.

With a small change in the dissimilarity formula between cluster centers, to 
also take account of cluster sizes, you could have Ward's minimum variance 
method.  Alternatively with a small change in the cluster update formula, to
*not* take cluster size into account, you get the Median or Gower or WPGMC
method.  

Note that in the case of the Centroid and Median methods, unlike Ward's method,
you can run into inversion or reversal problems, i.e. nonmonotic variation in 
the agglomerative criterion value.  You may be taking care of this situation
(I'm not 100% sure) in the part of your 'cluster.c' code where you have a 
comment: 'distance to new node is smaller than previous nnb, ...'.  With due
allowances made for non-unique situations, inversions cannot arise in the case
of the Ward method.

The single link method (as also the complete link or average link methods) don't
allow for the definition of a cluster center (which can subsequently be used
for calculating inter-cluster dissimilarity, as in the case of your 
implementation).

And... Another thing.  In carrying out an agglomeration, you scan the list of 
objects remaining and their nearest neighbors.  Each pair of 'reciprocal 
nearest neighbors' (i.e. x is NN of y, and y is NN of x) with a guarantee 
that there will be no untoward knock-on effects when determining the new 
cluster centers, - i.e. updating will be sufficiently local.  

More on this, etc., is in my 'Multidimensional Clustering Algorithms', 
Compstat Lectures 4, Physica-Verlag, 1985. 

Hope you don't mind me sending you this... Good luck with further development
of your program.

Many thanks for the message.  

There are of course clustering methods (and other methods which could also be 
useful - princ. comp. analysis, etc.) available in the mainstream 
commercial statistical packages - SAS, SPSS, BMDP, SYSTAT - and the manuals
of these packages often give a good, succinct overview of whatever methods are
available.  These are small selections of methods, though.  I myself use 
the S-Plus statistical language and graphics environment quite a bit.  At 
some point soon I hope to put some of my own code onto the Statlib server 
(see below).  S-Plus is commercial, and is an augmented version of S, 
developed by ATT Bell.  There is a package (again, commercial) called CLUSTAN 
which specializes in clustering methods, and is available from Clustan Ltd. 
in Edinburgh.  In biology and such fields, there are packages - one which I 
have not used is NT-SYS avaiable from F.J. Rohlf in SUNY - Stony Brook.  

A clustering-related list which periodically has information on code, or 
requests, is CLASS-L at Bitnet node sbccvm.  (Send one-liner: 'subscribe 
CLASS-L your-name' to listserv@sbccvm.bitnet)  

Statlib is the premier location for 'public domain' statistics code, it 
includes quite a bit of material for S, and it also includes some clustering
etc. code.  The Xgobi 3-d spin/rotation/etc. data viewer is standalone and
(hopefully still) is available there.  Algorithms from 'Applied Statistics'
have some (limited) clustering code, and there are also some things which I
put there (in area 'multiv' if I remember correctly) in the past (Fortran...).
To get started using Statlib, send the one-line message: 'send index' to 
'statlib@lib.stat.cmu.edu'.  Stablib is ftp'able at  'lib.stat.cum.edu', 
login with username 'statlib' (This access mechanism is probably available 
through gopher also.)

Hope this helps...  As you can see there is a lot around, but it might not
be in the shape that you want it.

All the best,

Fionn Murtagh

	 It has just worked okay for me.  Note that the node name is lib.stat.c
	mu.edu
	 (you wrote 'cum' instead of 'cmu' = Carniegie-Mellon Univ.).  Note als
	o that
	 this ftp access requires you to log in with username 'statlib' (so it'
	s not
	 anonymous ftp), and then you are asked to give your email address as a
	 password.

Got it now.  The problem was that there was a typo in the mail message
you sent to Andreas Stolcke in response to his clustering program.
Thanks for your help.

Charlie
