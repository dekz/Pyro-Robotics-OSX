These files implement the Pixel-to-Pixel stereo algorithm explained 
in the paper submitted to the International Journal of Computer
Vision, 1999.  It is only slightly different from the one presented in
the following two papers:

     "Depth Discontinuties by Pixel-to-Pixel Stereo"
     Proceedings of the Sixth IEEE International Conference on
         Computer Vision, Mumbai, India, pages 1073-1080, January 1998

     "Depth Discontinuities by Pixel-to-Pixel 
     Stanford University Technical Report STAN-CS-TR-96-1573, July 1996

STEPS:

(1) If you are running on an SGI, type "make p2p-SGI".
    Otherwise, type "make p2p".  
    (The only difference is the choice of compiler.  In our
    experience, the SGI's cc compiler generates code that is four
    times as fast as GNU's gcc.)

(2) To see how to run the code, type "p2p -h".
